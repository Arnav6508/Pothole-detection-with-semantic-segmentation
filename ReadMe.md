<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project focuses on detecting potholes on roads using semantic segmentation, a technique that classifies each pixel of an image into a predefined category. The model identifies potholes with high precision by segmenting them from the road surface in images or video frames. This solution leverages YOLO v11, a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, for semantic segmentation to achieve accurate and efficient real-time detection.
<br>
<h5>Potential Applications:</h5>

- <b>Smart Traffic Management</b>
Integration with traffic management systems to identify and prioritize the repair of potholes in high-traffic areas.

- <b>Autonomous Vehicles</b>
Enhancing autonomous navigation by providing vehicles with real-time road condition data, enabling safer and smoother travel.

## Methodology

Utilized YOLO v11 for semantic segmentation due to its real-time processing capability and high accuracy. The model was trained over 100 epochs.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are 2 functions in main.py :

- test_on_image
- test_on_video

Both the functions take path to the image/video respectively to generate output with potholes segmented.


### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arnav6508/Pothole-detection-with-semantic-segmentation
   ```

2. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
